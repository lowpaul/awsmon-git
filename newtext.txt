However, this instance would have rebooted because of any application crash or OS crash, 
As you might already be aware that due to shared responsibility model we do not have visibility on any of our customer OS,
so we would not be able to determine why the instance was rebooted. In order to determine on why this instance was rebooted,
I would request you to look into windows event logs.
